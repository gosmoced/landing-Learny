## 💡 About The Project
This project was built to master **Vue.js 3** and **precise layout implementation**. I selected a high-quality UI design from a freelance marketplace (Figma) and challenged myself to replicate it exactly ("Pixel Perfect"), but with clean and optimized code.

**My Goal:** Create a site that looks like art and loads instantly.

> **⚠️ Note:** This is a **Frontend-only** project (Static UI).
> The buttons, forms, and login are for visual demonstration (hover states, UI logic) and are not connected to a real backend.

### Key Highlights:
* **Zero External UI Libraries:** I wrote all CSS and adaptability logic manually (no Bootstrap or Tailwind) to keep the bundle size minimal.
* **Pixel Perfect:** The layout matches the original Figma design grid, spacing, and typography exactly.
* **Component Architecture:** The UI is broken down into reusable Vue components (Hero, Features, Cards, Footer) for better maintainability.
